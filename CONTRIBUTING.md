## Contributing to the code, examples or documentation

If you want to contribute to the development our code with a new feature, want to share your timex-example or add to the documentation, please follow the [GitHub contribution workflow (fork, branch, PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests) to share your work.

## Report bugs or errors

Something is not working as expected? You have two options:

### ðŸ¥ˆ Report an error
Please open a new issue in the `bw_timex` [repository](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_timex/issues), describing the error and where you found it.
A member of the bw_timex developer community will then take care of the issue, but it may take some time for your issue to be resolved.

### ðŸ¥‡  Fix an error yourself
If you have a solution to the error, you can [create a fork](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_timex/forks) of the `bw_timex` repository, make your changes and [create a pull request](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_timex/pulls). The developers will assess the changes and be eternally grateful!
