  abstract   = {Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) is useful to evaluate the environmental performance of current and emerging technologies in the future. Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technologies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improvements are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

  abstract = {The limitations of the static nature of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are well known. To overcome the loss of temporal information due to the aggregation of ﬂows in the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), several dynamic LCA methodologies have been proposed. In this paper we present a new generic and operational methodology for dynamic LCA that allows for the introduction of temporal information in both in the inventory and the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phases. The method makes use of graph traversal and convolution to calculate the temporally differentiated inventory, and makes it possible to use several types of dynamic impact assessment. We describe our method and apply it to a cradle-to-grave dynamic LCA of a glued laminated timber (glulam) product. We also test the sensitivity of the global warming results to temporal explicit LCI data. There is a considerable difference in outcome between the static and dynamic approaches. We have implemented our framework in the free and open source software Temporalis that is fully operational and can be used with existing LCA databases.},

	abstract = {While it may be impossible to accurately predict what the world will look like in the future, we can be certain that it will be different from the world of today. By extension, we know that using today's data in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies claiming to represent future scenarios is problematic. For the future impact of products to be estimated in a consistent and meaningful manner in LCA, the background system, most commonly the ecoinvent database, needs to be projected into the future alongside the foreground system modeled in a given study. Futura is a new piece of open-source software which allows LCA practitioners to create and share novel background databases representing arbitrary scenarios. It allows users to import a base database and then start making targeted changes. These changes take three main forms—adding new technologies, regionalizing new or existing technologies, and altering market compositions. All changes made are automatically added to a 'recipe.' This recipe file can be shared publicly. This recipe can be imported by other users and used to exactly recreate the modified database. The additive and transparent nature of this system means that initially simple scenarios can be built upon by others to progress toward more comprehensive scenarios in a stepwise manner. The inability to build on the work of others is a serious barrier to the progress of the LCA field. Futura goes some way to reduce this barrier in the field of prospective LCA.},
